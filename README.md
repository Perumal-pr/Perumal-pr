- 👋 Hi, I’m @Perumal-pr
- 👀 I am trying to become a MERN stack developer currently I'm learning React Hooks and future I have plans of learning the redux,tailwind css, Express and MongoDB with nodejs.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on startup projects so then I can learn new things with new teams everytime when I collab. And also try to make things crisp and sharp.
- 📫 You can ping me if you are okay with noob since I am new to this Git hub.
